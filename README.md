# Intel-on-the-Cloud
Welcome to the Intel-HPC-on-the-Cloud wiki!

Goal: Create Singularity containers for HPC apps and run them on the cloud for Single and Cluster runs

Singularity enables users to have full control of their environment. Singularity containers can be used to package entire scientific workflows, software and libraries, and even data. This means that you donâ€™t have to ask your cluster admin to install anything for you - you can put it in a Singularity container and run. More information are available on the main website Singularity

We will cover here:

* [Install Singularity](https://github.intel.com/sdouyeb/Intel-on-the-Cloud/wiki/Install-Singularity)

* [Build single HPC app container (MILC) and run on Google Cloud Engine (GEC)](https://github.intel.com/sdouyeb/Intel-on-the-Cloud/wiki/Build-single-HPC-app-container-(MILC)-and-run-on-Google-Cloud-Engine-(GEC))

* [Build a container with multiple apps (MILC, HACC) and run on GCE](https://github.intel.com/sdouyeb/Intel-on-the-Cloud/wiki/Build-a-container-with-multiple-apps-(MILC,-HACC)-and-run-on-GCE)

* Build an HPC container(NAMD) and run on a GEC cluster
